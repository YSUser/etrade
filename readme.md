E-TRADE
======

I wrote this lightweight framework to support my needs for completing project 1 on the [cs75 course](https://www.cs75.net/Projects).
It comes with form handling, session handling, error handling, encryption and request classes.
I also use [PHPass for hashing](http://www.openwall.com/phpass/)

A clean version of this framework can be found on the [clean_framework branch](https://github.com/YSUser/etrade/tree/clean_framework).

Issues
------
[ ] Encryption in the session handler needs to be debugged.
